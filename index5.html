                <h2 class="centre">2.1.1 Page Layout and Content</h2> 
                The layout of my page is very simplistic with each unit having its own page which is accessible via the tabs at the top of each page. Each tab is clearly labeled. I chose bright colours with white text in order to make the content stand out and legible but also quite calming.
                <br>
                I have gone for the same look on all the pages for a uniform look across the site. THis is important to me for the sake of consistency. All content on the page is centered for a more centralised look on the site. The text on the page has been well spaced out so it doesn't look word heavy and intimidating

                        “Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression.
<br>
Websites contain written material, graphics, business logos, and other visual and sound elements. This firmly categorizes them as copyrightable material.”
<br>
When building a website, it is important to be careful what material is used in the content of the site so as not to be liable for copyright infringement.⁷

                                Someone who has a vision impairment or sight disability may struggle to use the site I am building as I haven’t optimised it for such a person. Likewise someone who is hard of hearing, although there is no music on my site. In order to cater for said disabilities, I would need to make sure the site has an option where the characters can be enlarged/superimposed to allow for ease of reading.

                                        There is a long list of internet file types, depending on what is to be included in the building of the site. Some of the most popular are MPEG for video, MP3 for music, JPEG for images etc. I will be using the following for my site.
                                        <ul>
                                           <li><h3>HTML -  HyperText Markup Language</li>

                                        <li><h3>JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file</h3>
                                            "A very common image file format, mainly used for photos"⁸
