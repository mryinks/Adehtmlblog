<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    My name is Ade Adekoya. My career background is IT infrastructure support and management.
    I have over 5 years working experience in the industry.
    I have always been interested in computers from the very first time I encountered one as a child. 

</p>
<p>
    I love the idea of building something from scratch and see it manifest and also have a curiosity
for understanding how things work in the background, although the idea of coding has been quite 
an intimidating one for me. I came to Code Nation to further my knowledge particularly in 
software development and alleviate any fears I had.
</p>
<p>
    I have enjoyed my time at Code Nation as it has been quite a relief to know there are many others
 like me who are interested in furthering their software development knowledge. I initially came 
 to Code Nation to learn about Cyber Security and was advised to join the Software Developer’s 
 course after I had completed that course. I have learnt so much in my time at Code Nation 
 and as intimidated by the idea of coding.

   <h2>1.1 Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h2> 
IT is an important part of any modern business as it is almost impossible to run a successful 
business in this digital age without relying on some form of IT systems in place. From the basic 
task of sending and receiving emails to daily tasks like writing reports, filling in spreadsheets
, e-transactions via an online payment platform to complex tasks like building and designing network
 infrastructure. Companies rely on IT for fast communications, data processing and market 
 intelligence. IT plays a vital role in business, helping companies improve business processes, 
 achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth, improve productivity and maintain a competitive 
 advantage in the marketplace. ¹

<h2>1.2 Tools and Skills Required for a Successful Digital Project</h2>

There a number of factors to be considered in order to have a successful digital project. 
Projects are a regular part of modern businesses, from installation of new telephones, 
to the roll out of new software/technologies to site move. Many a project however fail 
due to a number of variables but we won’t be focusing on that today. Rather we will 
highlight what makes a project successful.²

<ul>
   <h3><li>Strong Project Manager/Team Leader</li></h3> 
A strong, competent and experienced Project leader is essential for the success of any Project.²

<h3><li>Clearly Defined Project Goals</li></h3>
The most successful projects consider the goals and purposes at hand. The purpose of the
 project must be clearly outlined for all team members.²

<h3><li>A Good Team</li></h3>
Acquiring  the right skilled and necessary team members and resources to see the project 
all the way through–from strategy to execution is integral to the success of said project.²

<h3><li>Good Management Tools</li></h3>
The success of a project is also dependant on a good management collaborative tool 
(such as Trello) used to manage and track the progress of the project, accessible by 
all team members.²

<h3><li>Effective Communication</li></h3>
Excellent communication between team members and management  will increase understanding
of what’s expected and likelihood of completing the task on schedule.²
</ul>

<h2>1.3 Planning My Website</h2>

Building the website will require a lot of efficient planning in order for it to be successful. 
Given the time frame allocated to complete the task, there isn’t a lot of time to build an 
elaborate and extensive site. The main objective is to build a website using HTML and CSS 
via Visual Studio Code including different components and tags to show I understand how 
each works. I will make use of the Trello Web App to plan every stage of the building of 
my website.  On Trello I will employ the use of visual cards and colour codes. The boards 
will be titled “To do” “Doing” “Done” with colours Red, Orange and Green respectively. 
This will help me organise and plan the project effectively

<h2>1.4 Risks That Impacts Digital Projects</h2>

Any project runs the risk of failure at different stages from inception to launch. 
There are a plethora of factors that could affect the success of a project. 
Here are some of the factors

<ul>
<h3><li>Poor Planning</li></h3>
In order to successfully execute a digital project, its is important to have a strong 
plan in place. A plan where each team member’s roles and responsibilities are defined 
they are aware of the schedule.³

<h3><li>Ill Defined Goals and Objectives</li></h3>
When the goals and objectives of a project is not clearly defined and outlined, requirements
are misinterpreted by the project team, which affects expectations and achievements.³

<h3><li>Bad Management</li></h3>
This can vary from leadership to time to cost. All of which require good experience and good
management. The project team may lack the authority to achieve project objectives without 
the right type of management.³

<h3><li>Poor Research</li></h3>
Lack of research into the project and what’s needed to make it successful before planning 
can be disastrous i.e the right software, skills and manpower.³

<h3><li>Poor Resource Management</li></h3>
Inability to secure sufficient resources (both manpower and tools) for the project. ³

<h3><li>Bad Communication</li></h3>
 Communication is the most important factor in having a successful project, If communication 
 fails, the whole is at risk of failure. Poor communication can affect all aspects of the project.³
