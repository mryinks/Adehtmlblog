<h2 class="centre">About Me</h2>
    My name is Ade Adekoya. My career background is IT infrastructure support and management.
    I have over 5 years working experience in the industry.
    I have always been interested in computers from the very first time I encountered one as a child. 
<br>
<br>
    I love the idea of building something from scratch and see it manifest and also have a curiosity
for understanding how things work in the background, although the idea of coding has been quite 
an intimidating one for me. I came to Code Nation to further my knowledge particularly in 
software development and alleviate any fears I had.
<br>
<br>
    I have enjoyed my time at Code Nation as it has been quite a relief to know there are many others
 like me who are interested in furthering their software development knowledge. I initially came 
 to Code Nation to learn about Cyber Security and was advised to join the Software Developerâ€™s 
 course after I had completed that course. I have learnt so much in my time at Code Nation 
 and as intimidated by the idea of coding.
