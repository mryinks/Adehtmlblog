                IT is an important part of any modern business as it is almost impossible to run a successful 
                business in this digital age without relying on some form of IT systems in place. From the basic 
                task of sending and receiving emails to daily tasks like writing reports, filling in spreadsheets
                , e-transactions via an online payment platform to complex tasks like building and designing network
                 infrastructure. Companies rely on IT for fast communications, data processing and market 
                 intelligence. IT plays a vital role in business, helping companies improve business processes, 
                 achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth, improve productivity and maintain a competitive 
                 advantage in the marketplace. ¹

                <h2 class="centre">1.2 Tools and Skills Required for a Successful Digital Project</h2>
                There a number of factors to be considered in order to have a successful digital project. 
                Projects are a regular part of modern businesses, from installation of new telephones, 
                to the roll out of new software/technologies to site move. Many a project however fail 
                due to a number of variables but we won’t be focusing on that today. Rather we will 
                highlight what makes a project successful.²
                <ul>
                   <li><h3>Strong Project Manager/Team Leader</li> 
                A strong, competent and experienced Project leader is essential for the success of any Project.²
                </h3>
                
                <h3><li>Clearly Defined Project Goals</h3>
                The most successful projects consider the goals and purposes at hand. The purpose of the
                 project must be clearly outlined for all team members.²
                </li>
                
                <li><h3>A Good Team</h3>
                Acquiring  the right skilled and necessary team members and resources to see the project 
                all the way through–from strategy to execution is integral to the success of said project.²
                </li>
                
                <li><h3>Good Management Tools</li>
                The success of a project is also dependant on a good management collaborative tool 
                (such as Trello) used to manage and track the progress of the project, accessible by 
                all team members.²
                </h3>
                
                <li><h3>Effective Communication</h3>
                Excellent communication between team members and management  will increase understanding
                of what’s expected and likelihood of completing the task on schedule.²

                <h2 class="centre">1.3 Planning My Website</h2>
                Building the website will require a lot of efficient planning in order for it to be successful. 
                Given the time frame allocated to complete the task, there isn’t a lot of time to build an 
                elaborate and extensive site. The main objective is to build a website using HTML and CSS 
                via Visual Studio Code including different components and tags to show I understand how 
                each works. I will make use of the Trello Web App to plan every stage of the building of 
                my website.  On Trello I will employ the use of visual cards and colour codes. The boards 
                will be titled “To do” “Doing” “Done” with colours Red, Orange and Green respectively. 
                This will help me organise and plan the project effectively

                <h2 class="centre">1.4 Risks That Impacts Digital Projects</h2>
                Any project runs the risk of failure at different stages from inception to launch. 
                There are a plethora of factors that could affect the success of a project. 
                Here are some of the factors
                <ul>
                <li><h3>Poor Planning</h3>
                In order to successfully execute a digital project, its is important to have a strong 
                plan in place. A plan where each team member’s roles and responsibilities are defined 
                they are aware of the schedule.³
                </li>
                
                <li><h3>Ill Defined Goals and Objectives</h3>
                When the goals and objectives of a project is not clearly defined and outlined, requirements
                are misinterpreted by the project team, which affects expectations and achievements.³
                </li>
                
                <li><h3>Bad Management</h3>
                This can vary from leadership to time to cost. All of which require good experience and good
                management. The project team may lack the authority to achieve project objectives without 
                the right type of management.³
                </li>
                
                <li><h3>Poor Research</h3>
                Lack of research into the project and what’s needed to make it successful before planning 
                can be disastrous i.e the right software, skills and manpower.³
                </li>
                
                <li><h3>Poor Resource Management</h3>
                Inability to secure sufficient resources (both manpower and tools) for the project. ³
                </li>
                
                <li><h3>Bad Communication</h3>
                 Communication is the most important factor in having a successful project, If communication 
                 fails, the whole is at risk of failure. Poor communication can affect all aspects of the project.³

                 <h2 class="centre">1.5 IT System and Software</h2> 
                    Choosing the right type of technology to complete the project/task at hand is very
                    important and instrumental to the success of the project. The best way to decide 
                    which technology or software is best to complete the job is to find out if anyone 
                    has done a similar project prior, what they used as well as pros and cons. 
                    Alternatively an extensive research on online will be useful in making said decision.

                <h2 class="centre">1.6 Selecting The Right Technology</h2> 
                I chose four different technologies to help me achieve the website build. Visual Studio Code, Trello, Github and a MacBook.
                <ul>
                        <li><h3>VS Code</h3>
                            is a good code editor software. It’s easy enough to navigate and user friendly. It’s allowed me to write both HTML and CSS in one and I also used it for a precious JavaScript Project.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Github</h3>
                            is a smart webapp that allows me to push all of my code and changes made to an online repository. This means I can download and work on building my site when I’m away from the office if I so which. This helps with remote working. It also means I can share my work with colleagues Using Github also allows to have version control so I can track the changes I made at different points during the project.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>Trello</h3>
                            has been useful in organising my work and planning my tasks, It allows me to visualise what’s left to be done. It also allows me to plan each day task by task and also by priority via colour codes. As with Git, Trello also allows you to share your boards with other collaborators and or manager.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3>MacBook</h3>
                            comes  with a user friendly and sleek OS with similar functionality to Windows which I am more familiar with and used to.

                        “As of May 2018, a new law was passed with relation to the collection and processing of personal data. GDPR applies to any company that uses data to offer goods and services or uses data to track online behavior within the EU regardless of the company's location”.”⁴
                        Many digital projects have the objective of implementing or enhancing software.  Part of the development cycle is the testing of software. This can mean using test data to ensure that the system works as required. Where testing involves using production data where it contains personal data, again, this will be captured under GDPR, which means the project has to be compliant. GDPR has a number of aims all designed to increase and standardise the protection of individuals including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>data portability</li>
