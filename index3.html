                                                Benefits -  The internet can be used as a source of learning and comparing you code if something doesn’t work during the build. It’s helpful to be able to compare codes and get ideas/knowledge on fixing the codes via Github.

                                                Drawbacks - Spent too long trying to design the site rather than researching the content. I would have prioritised my tasks and schedule using Trello more efficiently. Time constraints also meant I couldn’t make sure the site was optimised for websites too.

                            There a number of ways to improve productivity in the workplace, especially when working on a project. The following are some of the ways to making that happen
                            <ul>
                           <li>Track and manage effectively time spent on each task</li>
                            <li>Set Self Imposed deadlines</li>
                            <li>Take regular breaks</li>
                        <li>Have regular standups</li>
                            <li>Stop trying to make everything perfect</li>
                            <li>Be PROactive not REactive
                            Turn off all Notifications.⁶</li>

                    </h2>
                    In order to improve productivity, it might have been helpful and more efficient to work as part of a team or at least collaborated with other members of the project to share ideas via Slack (collaborative tool used in previous project). I would have also researched and used code editor app which allows me to work remotely in incidents when I find myself unable to work in the office. I would also make better use of Trello and break tasks into micro “bitesize” tasks with viable deadlines. It would have helped me manage my time and productivity better.

                        I would plan testing a digital solution by checking that the solutions are
                        <ul>
                       <li>Compatible with existing technologies

                            </li>
                        <li>Fit for the purpose of the actual task</li>
                    <li>Easily accessible via multiple platforms and or the internet
                        </li>
