                                The IT Tools mentioned in previous sections that were used in the building of the website have been useful for the successful completion of the task. Trello worked as an app as well as a web page. This was perfect as it meant I could add tasks or check on the progress of my work even when I was away from the laptop. VS Code was relatively straightforward to use with an inbuilt terminal that allowed me to export all my code. The only drawback is that VS code is a native app that can only be used on the laptop and cannot be accessed online for remote working.  However I overcame that dilemma with GitHub. Git like Trello allows me to access my account online but also push all of the versions of my code to it which means I can access it at any time and work on it using a different code editor. Git also allowed me to practice version control during the build process. MacBook was also relatively easy to adapt to. Navigation was a little tricky at first but got the hang of it as time went on. It was initially quite challenging as I’m used to using Windows and familiar with it’s navigation but adapted to the MacBook quite quickly after a few days of use.

                Each tool was appropriate and equal to the task, I’m unable to give an opinion as to whether there are better tools out there that could have done the job better or is more efficient. All four tools used in building my website did the job and did it well as a first time experience and I would use all tools again as well as recommend. The MacBook OS was very versatile and didn’t experience and lag or performance issues. Trello was very simple to use and straightforward (through there are advanced options for more complex projects). Github was perfect for exporting my files into the repository as an online storage while VS code was easy to use with a lot of the code syntax pre populated as a suggestion when typing out a code

                        I am Happy with the overall project. First time building a website from scratch using HTML & CSS. It was a great experience. 
<br>
<br>
Strengths - The tools used in building the site were effective and efficient. The website is simple and easy to navigate. It isn’t clogged up with too many buttons and options. I have gone for a minimalistic approach with the right of pages and information per page. It is well divided for a cleaner look.
<br>
<br>
Weaknesses - I would have liked to use more animation and fancy fonts for the final presentation of the website. I would have liked more time to research and explore colour/themes which can be more eye catching and attractive to the reader/visitor. I would have also preferred to use a Windows machine as opposed to Macbook which I wasn’t initially familiar with as this took some time to get used to, thus hindering productivity.

                                If I had more time I’d have liked to create a “burger” (3 horizontal lines) icon as a dropdown menu with all access to all the other pages hidden in there, which would be revealed when selected. I would also have liked to have more images along with some cool animations on the site as it’s currently word heavy.
